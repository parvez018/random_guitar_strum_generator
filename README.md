# Random 4-bit Guitar Strumming Pattern Generator
4-bit guitar strumming involves 4 down strums and 4 up strums alternatively. For a total of 8 strums, each one can be present or absent leading ot a total of `(2^8-1)=255` options (except for the one where none of the strums are present of course). Some of these patterns sounds very good and are used often. A good idea to find out good strumming patterns as well as identifying a pattern by hearing, is to try random patterns and play them. Here I made a tool that randomly generates this 4-bit strumming patterns to try for myself when I am practicing my acoustic guitar. 

Features include 
- Randomly generate one strumming
- Auto generate strummings continously 
- Play the currently generated strumming.
